//pip and python goes hand in hand

vertualenv -> Virtualenv is a tool that lets you create an isolated Python environment for your project. It creates an environment that has its own installation directories, that doesn’t share dependencies with other virtualenv environments (and optionally doesn’t access the globally installed dependencies either). You can even configure what version of Python you want to use for each individual environment. It's very much recommended to use virtualenv when dealing with Python applications.
 
vertualenvwrapper -> To make it easier to work on multiple projects that has separate environments you can install virtualenvwrapper. It's an extension to virtualenv and makes it easier to create and delete virtual environments without creating dependency conflicts.
